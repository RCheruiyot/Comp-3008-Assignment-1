# Comp-3008-Assignment-1

This project aims to create a social fitness app for friend groups. The goal of this app is to help friend groups interact with each other, motivate each other, and compete with each other. Users can create profiles, upload videos as proof of their personal records (PRs), track their progress, connect with friends, and compete on workout leaderboards.
